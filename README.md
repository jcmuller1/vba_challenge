# VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to gain experience with VBA while learning about ways to make code more efficient and expedient. This involved working through the creation of various macros within VBA, then refactoring and improving those macros to decrease runtime.

## Results

It is clear that the execution time of the analysis dropped dramatically after refactoring. The original runtimes are shown below:

while the runtimes for the refactored code are shown below:
